            1. Applicability of this Privacy Policy
          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Mejurix collects, uses, and discloses Personal Data when you: (a) use our
            website and online platform (collectively, our &quot;Services&quot;), or (b) otherwise interact with us (for example,
            by emailing us or speaking with our team).
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            Our Services are primarily offered to business customers (such as law firms or companies in the legal and
            healthcare industries) for professional use. We enter into agreements with our customers (for example,
            platform subscription agreements and data processing agreements) to provide the Services. Important: This
            Privacy Policy does not apply to the content that our customers upload to our platform or the outputs
            generated by our AI in the course of providing the Services. For instance, documents, medical records, case
            files, and summaries that you or our customers input into the platform are &quot;Customer Data&quot; or &quot;Content,&quot;
            which we process on behalf of our customers in order to provide the service. We handle that data according
            to our contract with the customer, and the customer is responsible for the data.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            This means if you have questions or requests regarding personal information contained in Customer Data, you
            should contact the relevant customer (e.g. the law firm or organization who provided your data to our
            platform).
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data that Mejurix collects and controls as part of our own
            operations â€“ for example, information you provide when creating an account, visiting our website, or
            communicating with us. In those contexts, Mejurix is the organization deciding how and why the data is used
            (often called the &quot;data controller&quot; or &quot;business&quot; under privacy laws).
          </p>

          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            We collect Personal Data in the course of doing business and providing our Services. The types of
            information we collect fall into a few categories:
          </p>

          <ul style={{ marginBottom: "24px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong> This is information you give us when you sign up for or
              use our Services or otherwise communicate with us. For example:
              <ul style={{ marginTop: "12px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you or your organization creates an account with us, we
                  collect details such as your name, email address, professional information (for example, your job
                  title or area of practice), language preference, account credentials, billing/payment information, and
                  transaction history.
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Communication Information:</strong> If you contact us (for example, for support, inquiries
                  about our Services, or to participate in a survey), we collect the content of your messages and any
                  information you choose to provide. This may include your name, email address, profession or job role,
                  and the nature of your inquiry or feedback. We also record your communication preferences (e.g., if
                  you subscribe to newsletters or opt out of certain communications).
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Social Media Information:</strong> We maintain pages on social media platforms like LinkedIn,
                  X (formerly Twitter), or YouTube. If you interact with our social media pages or content, we may
                  receive Personal Data that you choose to share with us. For example, you might provide your contact
                  details or send us messages via those platforms. We may also receive aggregate information (such as
                  analytics) from the social media sites about how users interact with our pages.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Information We Collect Automatically:</strong> Like many companies, we automatically collect
              certain information about your device and your use of our Services. This includes:
              <ul style={{ marginTop: "12px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Log Data:</strong> When you use our website or platform, our systems automatically record
                  information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, device
                  identifiers, the pages or features you accessed, the dates/times of access, and other usage details.
                  This data (called &quot;log data&quot;) helps us administer the Services and understand how they are being used.
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about your interactions with our Services, such as
                  how often you use the platform, the features or modules you click on, the queries or actions you
                  perform, and the duration of your sessions. This usage data helps us analyze and improve the
                  performance of our AI platform and tailor it to user needs.
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies, scripts, and similar tracking
                  technologies to personalize your experience and collect information about your usage of our Services.
                  Cookies are small text files placed on your device that allow us to recognize you on future visits.
                  They help us remember your preferences, understand which parts of our site are popular, and show you
                  content or advertisements relevant to your interests. We may also use similar technologies like web
                  beacons or local storage for these purposes. Your Choices: You can set your browser to refuse all or
                  some cookies or to alert you when cookies are being used. However, if you disable cookies, some
                  features of our Services might not function properly. (For more details on how we use cookies and how
                  you can manage them, please see our Cookie Policy available on our website.)
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Device Information:</strong> When you access our Services, we receive information about the
                  device you&apos;re using. This may include details like the device type (e.g., laptop, tablet, smartphone),
                  device model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and your web browser
                  type/version. This device information helps ensure our Services work correctly on different devices
                  and assists with troubleshooting technical issues.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Information from Third Parties:</strong> We may receive Personal Data about you from other
              sources, such as:
              <ul style={{ marginTop: "12px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Security/Fraud Prevention Partners:</strong> For example, we might use third-party services
                  that provide us with alerts or information to help detect and prevent fraud, cyberattacks, or other
                  unauthorized activities. These partners might provide data like IP addresses or threat intelligence
                  that helps us keep our platform secure.
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Marketing and Referral Partners:</strong> We could receive your information from marketing
                  agencies, data providers, or referral programs. For example, if you attended a conference or webinar
                  and showed interest in our product, the event organizer might share attendee contact info with us. Or,
                  a business partner might suggest that we reach out to you and provide your name and email. We use this
                  information to identify potential customers and inform them about our Services (in accordance with
                  applicable marketing laws).
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> If we run targeted advertising campaigns, we might work with
                  advertisers or analytics firms that provide us with information on how our ads perform or about your
                  interactions with our ads (for instance, if you clicked an ad for Mejurix on a third-party site). This
                  helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and reach audiences who are interested in our
                  Services.
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Event and Networking Contacts:</strong> If our team meets you at an industry event, trade
                  show, or through professional networking, we might collect your business card or contact details with
                  your consent. Additionally, organizers of events or directories may give us lists of participants
                  which include your work contact information. We only use such information to follow up on business
                  opportunities or connections in a professional context.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Publicly Available Information:</strong> We may also gather information from public sources. For
              example, we might use information from public websites, public profiles, or published materials to improve
              our Services and train our AI models. This could include publicly available medical literature, court
              judgments, legal filings, or other documents that are relevant to medical-legal research. We use this
              information to develop and refine our platform&apos;s capabilities. When we use public data, we take steps to
              minimize any impact on individual privacy. For instance, if we use aggregated or anonymized data sets, we
              will not attempt to re-identify individuals from that data (unless required by law). Publicly available
              information may also be used to help verify credentials or prevent fraud (for example, confirming a law
              firm&apos;s business address from a public registry).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            We collect and use the Personal Data described above for the purposes explained in the next section. If any
            additional Personal Data is collected in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy or provide you with
            appropriate notice.

            3. How We Use Personal Data
          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            We use your Personal Data for the following purposes, all in support of providing a high-quality and secure
            service:
          </p>

          <ul style={{ marginBottom: "24px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Providing and Improving the Services:</strong> We use information to deliver our platform and
              services to you, ensure they function as intended, and maintain their quality. This includes using
              Personal Data to set up your account, authenticate you when you log in, process transactions (such as
              subscription payments), and provide the features of our AI platform (such as generating medical-legal
              summaries). We also use data to debug and improve the platform â€“ for example, to fix bugs, enhance AI
              accuracy, and develop new features or tools that make the service more useful.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Research and Development:</strong> Your information (along with data from other users) helps us to
              conduct research and analysis aimed at improving our artificial intelligence algorithms and overall
              Service performance. For instance, understanding how users interact with certain features can guide us in
              making those features more intuitive. In some cases, we may use anonymized data sets to train our machine
              learning models so they become more accurate over time.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Personalization:</strong> We may use Personal Data to personalize your experience. This could mean
              customizing the content you see, remembering your preferences (such as language or dashboard settings),
              and tailoring our Services to better suit your professional needs. For example, knowing your role (lawyer,
              healthcare professional, etc.) might allow us to highlight relevant features or resources when you use the
              platform.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Communicating with You:</strong> We use contact information like your email address to communicate
              with you. This includes sending you Service-related announcements or notifications (for example, updates
              about your account, confirmations of transactions, security alerts, or important updates to our platform).
              If you have opted in, we may also send marketing communications such as newsletters, product updates,
              event invites, or other information we think may be of interest to you. (You can always opt out of
              marketing emails as described in the Your Data Protection Rights section below.) We might also contact you
              to follow up on feedback or inquiries you&apos;ve submitted, or to provide customer support.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Customer Support:</strong> If you reach out to us with a question, feedback, or an issue, we will
              use the information you provided (and any relevant information from your account or usage of the platform)
              to assist you and resolve problems. This might involve troubleshooting technical issues, responding to
              feature questions, or addressing any concerns you have about the Services.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> Personal Data is used to protect our Services and our
              users. For example, we monitor usage patterns to detect suspicious or unauthorized activities. Information
              like IP addresses and device data can help us verify user identities and prevent fraudulent use of
              accounts. We also may use data to enforce our terms of service and to prevent misuse of the platform (such
              as activities that violate the law or our agreements).
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Legal Compliance and Enforcement:</strong> We may process Personal Data as needed to comply with
              our legal obligations. This includes using data to satisfy reporting obligations, to respond to valid
              legal requests (such as subpoenas or court orders), or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. We
              also use and retain data as necessary to enforce our agreements (for example, to ensure users are abiding
              by licensing terms) and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mejurix, our users, or others. For
              instance, if necessary, we might use account information to contact a user about an issue related to
              compliance or risk.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            In addition to the above, we may use your information to assess eligibility for certain offers or to market
            our services to you (where lawful). For example, we might analyze your profile or how you use the Services
            to suggest other features or products that could be useful to you. If the law requires us to get your
            consent for certain marketing activities (such as in Canada&apos;s anti-spam laws or specific U.S. state laws),
            we will do so.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>Aggregated and De-Identified Data:</strong> We sometimes aggregate or anonymize Personal Data so
            that it can no longer be linked to any specific individual. We may use this aggregated data for purposes
            such as statistical analysis, Service improvement, and academic or marketing insights. For example, we might
            publish trends or metrics (e.g., average time saved by users when using our AI summaries) that are based on
            aggregated usage data. This information will not identify you personally. We do not attempt to re-identify
            individuals from anonymized data. If, in rare cases, we ever need to re-associate anonymized data with an
            individual (for example, to investigate a security incident), we would only do so if permitted by law.
          </p>

          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            We do not sell your Personal Data to third parties for profit. However, we do share certain information with
            third parties in a few situations as part of running our business and providing our Services. The categories

              <strong>Our Affiliates:</strong> If Mejurix ever becomes part of a group of related companies (for
              instance, if we establish subsidiaries or partner with another company under common ownership), we may
              share Personal Data with those affiliated entities. They would use the information in line with this
              Privacy Policy (for example, to assist in providing or improving the Services). This kind of sharing helps
              us operate effectively across different teams and locations. (If Mejurix does not have any affiliates at

            providing the agreed-upon service to us. In other words, they can&apos;t independently decide to use your data
            for their own marketing or share it with others (unless it&apos;s necessary to carry out the work we&apos;ve hired
            them to do, and even then, under strict terms). We have contracts in place with our service providers that
            obligate them to safeguard your Personal Data to a standard comparable to our own safeguards.

              <strong>Third-Party Integrations (at Your Direction):</strong> If our platform allows integrations with
              third-party applications or services (for example, if you choose to connect our Service with a tool like
              Microsoft Word or a legal practice management software via an API or plugin), then with your
              authorization, we will share the necessary data with that third-party application to enable the
              integration. Likewise, the third party might share data back to our platform. For instance, if you link
              your calendar app, we might receive scheduling information; or if you export a report to a third-party
              service, that service will receive the content you export. Please note: Any information transferred to a
              third-party application is governed by that third party&apos;s own privacy policy and terms. We recommend
              reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party services you integrate with our platform. We are not
              responsible for how those third parties use your data once you&apos;ve directed us to send it to them.

              <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If Mejurix undergoes a business transaction such as a merger,
              acquisition by another company, reorganization, or sale of all or part of our assets, your Personal Data
              may be disclosed to potential buyers or other parties involved in the transaction (e.g., as part of a
              confidential due diligence process). If the transaction is completed, your information may be transferred
              to the successor or new owner so that the Service can continue to operate. In such cases, we will require
              that your Personal Data remains subject to protections at least as strict as those outlined in this
              Privacy Policy. We will also provide notice on our website (and, if applicable, directly to you) if a new
              company will be taking ownership of your Personal Data, along with any choices you may have. Similarly, if
              Mejurix ever undergoes bankruptcy or other change of control, Personal Data could be considered an asset
              and transferred accordingly, but again, the use of your data would remain subject to this Privacy Policy
              (unless you are notified of changes).

              <strong>Legal and Regulatory Disclosure:</strong> We may share your Personal Data with third parties such
              as law enforcement agencies, regulators, government authorities, or other organizations when we believe
              it&apos;s legally necessary or appropriate to do so. Situations where this might occur include:

                  request that compels us to disclose information (for example, a court order to provide data for a
                  legal proceeding), we will comply as required by law.

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>

                  someone is suspected of hacking into our system, we may share data with law enforcement to
                  investigate. Likewise, if a user&apos;s actions threaten the safety of other people, property, or our
                  systems, we may report that to appropriate authorities.

                  order to enforce or apply our Terms of Service or other agreements, and to investigate potential
                  violations. For instance, if needed to collect a debt or resolve a dispute, relevant data might be
                  shared with parties involved in that process.

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  <strong>Professional Advisors:</strong> In the normal course of business, we may also share relevant
                  parts of your information with our professional advisors (such as our lawyers, accountants, insurers,
                  and auditors) when it&apos;s necessary for them to provide us with advice or to protect our legal rights.
                  These advisors are typically bound by confidentiality obligations.

            In all cases of sharing, we only share the minimum amount of Personal Data necessary for the purpose at
            hand, and we strive to ensure that any third parties who receive the data handle it with appropriate care
            and security. We do not sell personal information to data brokers or unrelated parties for their own
            marketing. We also do not share your personal information with third parties for their independent use
            unless you have specifically requested or consented to such sharing.

            5. How We Keep Your Personal Data Secure
          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            The security of your Personal Data is very important to us. We use a combination of technical and
            organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
            destruction. For example, we employ measures such as encryption (to protect data in transit and at rest),
            access controls (so that only authorized personnel can access data on a need-to-know basis), and network
            security technologies (like firewalls and intrusion detection systems). We also train our staff on data
            protection best practices and limit access to Personal Data only to those employees and contractors who need
            it to perform their jobs.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            In addition, we periodically review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and
            updated methods. We also engage in testing and monitoring of our systems to prevent vulnerabilities. If we
            use third-party service providers to store or process data (such as cloud hosting services), we choose
            reputable providers and require them to maintain strong security practices.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            Despite all these efforts, it&apos;s important to understand that no method of transmitting or storing data is
            100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. In the
            unlikely event of a data breach that affects your Personal Data, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact
            and notify you and/or the appropriate authorities as required by law.
          </p>

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: "24px", fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "40px", marginBottom: "20px" }}>
            6. International Data Transfers
          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            Mejurix is a Canada-based company, but we serve users in both the United States and Canada (and potentially
            elsewhere). As a result, your Personal Data may be transferred to and stored in different countries. For
            example, information we collect might be processed on servers located in the United States or in another
            country outside of your home jurisdiction. Similarly, some of our service providers might be located in the
            U.S. or other countries, so your data could be accessible to them from those locations.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>Different Privacy Laws:</strong> If you are located in Canada, please note that when your Personal
            Data is transferred to the United States (or another country), it will be subject to the laws of that
            country. For instance, data stored in the U.S. might be accessed by U.S. government or law enforcement
            agencies under U.S. laws. Likewise, if you are in the U.S. and your data is processed in Canada, it will be
            subject to Canadian law. The privacy protections in these jurisdictions may differ from the protections in
            your country. However, regardless of where your data is processed, we will protect it as described in this
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>Our Safeguards for Cross-Border Transfers:</strong> Whenever we transfer Personal Data across
            borders, we take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information. These
            safeguards may include:
          </p>

          <ul style={{ marginBottom: "24px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Contractual Protections:</strong> We may implement standard data protection clauses (standard
              contractual clauses) or similar agreements with our service providers to contractually require that your
              data receives a high level of protection, no matter where it is transferred.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Access and Security Measures:</strong> We limit which of our team members and service providers
              can access Personal Data based on necessity, and we use technical measures like encryption to add an extra
              layer of protection during transfer.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Policy and Procedure:</strong> Our internal policies ensure that any transfer of data is done in
              compliance with applicable privacy laws. We also assess the risk of each transfer and adapt our practices
              as needed to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your data.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            By using our Services or providing information to us, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data to
            countries outside of your own country (including the United States and Canada). We will of course continue
            to safeguard that Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about
            international data transfers or require more specific information about the safeguards we use, you can
            contact us using the information in the How to Contact Us section.

            7. Data Retention
          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            We retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for,
            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. In other words,
            we will keep your information for as long as you are a user of our Services or as long as needed to achieve
            the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            Here are some factors we consider when determining how long to retain data:
          </p>

          <ul style={{ marginBottom: "24px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Providing the Service:</strong> If you have an account or subscription with us, we will keep the
              information associated with your account while your account is active. We retain this information to
              provide you with the Service, maintain your account, and to be able to address any issues that arise. If
              you close your account, we will delete or anonymize your Personal Data within a reasonable period after
              account closure, except for data we must keep for legal reasons (explained below).
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Contractual Commitments:</strong> For our business customers, the terms of the customer agreement
              may specify retention requirements. For example, our contract with a law firm might state how long we will
              retain uploaded content or account data. In such cases, we follow the contractual requirements. If a
              customer asks us to delete certain data as part of the service, we will do so as outlined in our agreement
              with them.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Legal Obligations and Disputes:</strong> We may need to retain certain information to comply with
              legal obligations. For instance, financial records (which may include transaction history and billing
              information) might be kept for a number of years as required by tax law or accounting rules. If we&apos;re
              involved in a dispute or investigation, we might retain relevant information until the matter is resolved,
              to protect our legal rights. We also keep records to demonstrate compliance with privacy and other laws
              (for example, keeping track of who has opted out of marketing, or records of consents given).
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Business Needs:</strong> In some cases, we might retain limited information for business
              operations. For example, if you contacted customer support, we might keep a record of that correspondence
              to help us if you contact us again or to improve our support processes. Also, basic contact information
              might be kept to follow up on potential business opportunities if you expressed interest in our Services.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            When we no longer have a legitimate business need or legal reason to keep your Personal Data, we will take
            steps to delete, destroy, or permanently anonymize it. If deletion (or anonymization) is not immediately
            possible â€“ for example, because the data is stored in a backup archive that is not easily accessible â€“ we
            will securely store the data and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. In practical
            terms, this means the data may remain in our archives for a certain period, but we will not process or use
            it for any other purpose during that time.

            If you are a resident of the United States, and particularly if you are a California consumer, you may have
            certain privacy rights under U.S. state laws (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended

              <strong>No Sale of Personal Data:</strong> We do not sell your Personal Data to third parties for money.
              We also do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their independent marketing purposes.
              However, we want to be transparent that we do use cookies and third-party analytics/advertising services
              that may collect information about your visits to our site to show you Mejurix ads on other websites. Some
              state laws (like California&apos;s CCPA) define this type of sharing as a &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;sharing&quot; of personal
              information, even if no money is exchanged. In those cases, you have the right to opt out of such sharing.
              We provide mechanisms to do so (for example, a &quot;Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information&quot; link on our
              website, if required). We also confirm that we do not knowingly sell or share personal information of
              minors under 18 years of age.

              <strong>Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to request that we disclose what personal information
              we have collected about you. Once we receive and confirm a verifiable consumer request from you, and as
              required by law, we will provide you with information such as: the categories of personal information we
              collected, the sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting it, and the
              categories of third parties with whom we shared or disclosed the information. We will also, if requested,
              provide the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you. (Please note that we may be
              limited by law in what specific data we can disclose in order to protect the security and privacy of you
              and othersâ€”for example, we won&apos;t disclose sensitive information like passwords or any specific pieces of
              data that could create a security risk.)

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request deletion of personal information we have
              collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Our global practice (as described in
              Section 10 below) is to allow you to request deletion of your data. If you ask us to delete your personal
              information, we will do so unless retaining the information is necessary for us to complete a transaction
              with you, detect security incidents, comply with a legal obligation, or another exception permitted under
              applicable law.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Opt Out of &quot;Sale&quot; or &quot;Sharing&quot;:</strong> As mentioned, while we don&apos;t sell data for
              money, we may share some data for advertising purposes which could be considered a &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;sharing&quot;
              under California law. You have the right to direct us not to sell or share your personal information in
              this way. If you prefer that we not use your data for targeted advertising or any similar purpose that
              falls under &quot;sale/sharing,&quot; you can opt out. To exercise this right, you can use the &quot;Do Not Sell or
              Share&quot; link on our website (if available) or contact us directly (see How to Contact Us). Once we process
              your opt-out request, we will stop the disclosure of your data to advertising partners for targeted
              advertising. (Please be aware that this does not stop all ads â€“ you may still see non-targeted ads about
              Mejurix, but they would not be based on your personal data).
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Correct:</strong> Under some state laws (like California&apos;s CPRA), you have the right to
              request that we correct inaccurate personal information we hold about you. If you believe any of your
              information is incorrect, you can contact us to request a correction. We may need to verify the accuracy
              of the new information you provide and certain documentation may be required for verification, depending
              on the nature of the information.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of
              your rights. This means if you choose to exercise your privacy rights (such as requesting deletion or
              opting out of sale/sharing), we will not deny you our Services, charge you a different price, or provide
              you a lower quality of service just because you exercised your rights. (Note: If deletion of data or
              opt-out from certain processing impacts our ability to provide the Service, we will inform you of the
              consequences. But we will never retaliate or impose punitive effects due to your privacy choices.)

          </ul>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>How to Exercise U.S. Rights:</strong> If you are a U.S. consumer and would like to exercise any of
            the above rights, you (or an authorized agent acting on your behalf) can submit a request to us. The easiest
            way is to contact us via email or mailing address provided in How to Contact Us (Section 12). Please clearly
            state that you are making a &quot;U.S. Privacy Rights Request&quot; and specify which right you wish to exercise
            (e.g., access request, deletion request, opt-out of sale/sharing). We will need to verify your identity to
            process certain requests â€“ this might involve confirming details we have on file (such as your email address
            or last interaction with us) to ensure we are fulfilling requests for the correct individual. We will
            respond to your request within the timeframe required by law (generally within 45 days for California, with
            the possibility to extend once for an additional 45 days with notice to you). If we need more information to
            verify or complete your request, we will let you know. For opt-out of sale/sharing requests, we will comply
            as soon as feasibly possible.

            For Users in Canada:
          </h3>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            If you are in Canada, your personal information is protected by laws such as the Personal Information
            Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) at the federal level, as well as provincial privacy laws in
            certain jurisdictions (for example, Alberta&apos;s PIPA, BC&apos;s PIPA, or Quebec&apos;s privacy act for the private
            sector). Mejurix is committed to complying with these Canadian privacy laws. Here&apos;s what that means for you:
          </p>

          <ul style={{ marginBottom: "24px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Consent and Purpose:</strong> We will collect, use, and disclose your personal information with
              your knowledge and consent, except where otherwise permitted or required by law. In practice, this means
              that when you provide us personal information, we assume you consent to our reasonable use of that
              information in line with this Privacy Policy and the nature of our dealings with you. We will not use your
              information for a new purpose that we haven&apos;t informed you about without obtaining any necessary consent.
              For example, if we wanted to use your information for a purpose not covered by this policy, we would seek
              your consent first.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Access to Your Information:</strong> You have the right to request access to the personal
              information we hold about you. Subject to certain exceptions (for instance, if providing access would
              reveal personal information about another individual or if it&apos;s subject to legal privilege or security
              concerns), we will let you know what personal data we have, what it&apos;s being used for, and to whom it has
              been disclosed. You can make an access request by contacting us (see How to Contact Us). We may need to
              verify your identity and may ask for specifics about the information you need. We will respond within a
              reasonable time, and we may charge a minimal fee if required by law (we will inform you of any fee in
              advance).
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Correction:</strong> If any of your personal information is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the
              right to request a correction. We rely on you to provide accurate information and to update us on any
              changes. If you find that we have incorrect information about you (for example, an outdated email or an
              incorrect name spelling), please let us know. We will correct the information where appropriate and send
              the corrected information to any third party that we may have shared it with (where necessary). If for
              some reason we cannot make the requested correction (for example, if it&apos;s information that we did not
              originally create or if there is a legal reason we cannot change it), we will explain the reason and note
              your request in our records.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> You have the right (with reasonable notice to us) to withdraw your
              consent to our continued use or disclosure of your personal information. For example, if you previously
              consented to receive our newsletter, you can unsubscribe at any time (withdrawing consent for that
              specific use). If you withdraw consent for us to use your information in a manner that is necessary for us
              to provide the Services, we will let you know if your withdrawal may mean we can no longer provide you
              with certain features or Services. Withdrawing consent will not retroactively undo any processing we have
              already done, but we will stop the future use of your data for those purposes. Note that sometimes we
              might have legal grounds to continue processing some of your data even after you withdraw consent (for
              instance, to retain transaction records for legal compliance), but we will inform you if that is the case.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Data Storage and Transfers:</strong> In compliance with Canadian best practices, we inform you
              that your personal information may be stored or processed outside of Canada, including in the United
              States. As described in Section 6 (International Data Transfers), if your data is in another country, it
              is subject to that country&apos;s laws (which might be different from Canadian law). We will ensure, through
              contracts or other means, that if your data is handled by third parties outside Canada, they will provide
              a comparable level of protection for your privacy. You can contact us for more information about our
              policies regarding offshore processing of personal data.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>No Sales of Personal Information:</strong> Similar to our U.S. statement, Mejurix does not sell
              your personal information to third parties. We handle personal information in accordance with the purposes
              described in this policy or as otherwise authorized by you. Any disclosures to third-party service
              providers are for the identified business purposes and not for those parties to use your data for their
              own unrelated purposes.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Questions or Complaints:</strong> If you have a question or complaint about how we handle your
              personal information, we encourage you to contact us first so we can address your concern. We will
              investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints. However, you also have the right to contact the Privacy
              Commissioner of Canada or your provincial privacy commissioner (if applicable) to discuss any concerns or
              file a complaint. For example, if you&apos;re in Canada and not satisfied with our response, you can reach out
              to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) at https://www.priv.gc.ca/ or via mail/phone as
              listed on their website. We will cooperate with any inquiries or guidance from privacy authorities to
              resolve the matter.

          </ul>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            We value the privacy of our Canadian users and strive to handle personal information in a transparent and
            accountable manner, consistent with the principles of Canadian privacy law (such as the Ten Fair Information
            Principles under PIPEDA).

          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            Our Services and website are not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect
            Personal Data from anyone under 18 years old. If you are under 18, please do not use our platform or provide
            any information about yourself.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            If we discover that we have inadvertently collected Personal Data from a person under 18, we will take
            prompt steps to delete such information from our records. For example, if a minor were to sign up with false
            information and we later learn of their age, we would remove their account and data.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>Parents and Guardians:</strong> If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us with
            personal information, please contact us immediately (see How to Contact Us below). We will investigate and,
            if appropriate, delete the information to ensure it is removed from our systems.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            By using our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age. We reserve the right to request
            proof of age from users if we suspect someone using our Service might be underage.

            10. Your Data Protection Rights
          </h2>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            We believe in user empowerment and transparency. Depending on where you reside and subject to applicable
            laws, you have a number of rights regarding your personal data. Below is an overview of those rights and how
            you can exercise them:
          </p>

          <ul style={{ marginBottom: "24px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request access to your Personal Data that we hold.
              This means you can ask us to confirm whether we are processing your Personal Data and request a copy of
              that data, as well as information about how we use it. We will provide you with a copy of the Personal
              Data we have about you, in a commonly used format, if you request it. (For U.S. users, this encompasses
              the &quot;Right to Know&quot; described in the U.S. section above; for Canadian users, this is the right of access
              under PIPEDA.)
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Correction:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any inaccuracies in
              your Personal Data. If you find that any information we have is wrong or incomplete (for example, your
              name, contact info, or account details), please let us know. We will correct it where appropriate. We may
              need to verify the new information you provide, but once that&apos;s done, we&apos;ll update our records and inform
              any third parties (who received the incorrect data from us) of the change if necessary.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Deletion (Right to Erasure):</strong> You have the right to request deletion of your
              Personal Data. This is sometimes called the &quot;right to be forgotten.&quot; Upon your request (and in line with
              applicable law), we will delete your Personal Data from our active systems. Keep in mind there may be
              situations where we cannot delete data entirely â€“ for example, if we are required by law to keep certain
              records (like invoices), or if the data is needed to exercise or defend legal claims. If we must retain
              information for legal reasons, we will inform you. Otherwise, we will make good faith efforts to comply
              with your deletion request and will also direct our service providers to delete your information from
              their records where applicable.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Object to Processing:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your
              Personal Data in certain circumstances. For example, if we are processing your data based on our
              &quot;legitimate interests&quot; (a concept under European and similar laws) or for direct marketing, you can object
              to that. While this specific legal term of &quot;legitimate interest&quot; is a concept under laws like the GDPR
              (which we are not explicitly subject to in the U.S./Canada context of this policy), as a general practice,
              if you have an objection to how we are handling your data, we want to know and we will consider your
              request seriously. In some cases, we may have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing (for
              instance, security or legal compliance reasons), but we will evaluate each request on its merits.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to ask us to limit or &quot;pause&quot; the
              processing of your Personal Data in certain situations. This could apply if you contest the accuracy of
              the data (until we verify it), or if you believe our processing is unlawful but you prefer we restrict use
              of the data rather than delete it, or if you need us to keep the data longer than our retention period for
              the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. When processing is restricted, we will store your
              data securely and not use it except to the extent allowed by you or as necessary for legal compliance.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of certain Personal Data
              in a machine-readable format, and you have the right to have that data transmitted to another
              organization, where technically feasible. This right typically applies to information you provided to us
              (and that we processed with your consent or to perform a contract, if applicable). In practice, if you
              request it, we can provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and data you&apos;ve
              provided to us, so that you can transfer it to another service if you wish.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Opt Out of Marketing:</strong> You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from
              us at any time. If you no longer want to receive emails about product updates, events, or other news, you
              can click the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; link that we include in all our promotional emails. Alternatively, you can
              contact us at any time to let us know your preferences (see How to Contact Us). Please note that even if
              you opt out of marketing messages, we may still send you important administrative or transactional
              messages (for example, an email to reset your password, a notice about a security update, or information
              about your account usage) since these are not marketing communications.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> In cases where we rely on your consent to process your
              Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. For instance, if you consented to
              us using your testimonial on our website, you can later ask us to remove it. Withdrawing consent will not
              affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal â€“ in other words, it won&apos;t
              undo past actions â€“ but it will stop us from continuing the specific activity you withdraw consent from.
              If you withdraw consent for something that is necessary for us to provide the Service (for example, use of
              your email address), we will let you know if that withdrawal means we cannot continue to provide you some
              features of the Service.
            </li>

            <li style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
              <strong>Right to Complain to a Regulator:</strong> We take your privacy seriously and will do our best to
              address any concerns you have directly. However, if you believe we have not handled your Personal Data
              properly or have violated your rights, you have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority
              or regulator. For example:
              <ul style={{ marginTop: "12px", paddingLeft: "24px" }}>
                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  In Canada, you can contact the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) or your provincial
                  privacy commissioner (if applicable) to discuss any concerns or file a complaint.
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  In certain U.S. states, you may have the right to contact your state&apos;s Attorney General or a dedicated
                  privacy regulator (for example, the California Privacy Protection Agency for issues relating to
                  CCPA/CPRA) to lodge a complaint.
                </li>

                <li style={{ marginBottom: "12px" }}>
                  If other laws apply to you (for instance, if you are a visitor from the EU or UK), you may contact a
                  Data Protection Authority in the appropriate country. (Note: Since this policy is focused on U.S. and
                  Canada, we are not detailing EU/UK authorities here, but you still have that right if applicable.)

          </ul>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            We encourage you to reach out to us first, and we will do our best to resolve your issue. But we want you to
            know that these formal channels are available to you as well.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>Exercising Your Rights:</strong> To exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us
            using the information provided in How to Contact Us (Section 12). In your request, clearly describe which
            right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. For example, if you want a copy of your
            data, specify the data you&apos;re referring to (certain data might be exempt from portability, for instance). If
            you want us to delete certain information, it helps to specify which information (e.g., &quot;please delete my
            account and associated data&quot; or &quot;please remove my email from your mailing list and delete any records of my
            inquiry from last year&quot;).
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>Verification:</strong> For your protection, we will need to verify your identity before fulfilling
            certain requests (such as access or deletion requests) to ensure that your Personal Data is not disclosed to
            someone impersonating you. Verification might involve confirming some information we already have on file
            (e.g., responding to an email from your registered email address or providing a piece of identifying
            information).
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>Authorized Agents:</strong> If you wish to have an authorized agent make a request on your behalf
            (applicable notably for California residents), we will require proof of the agent&apos;s authority to act and may
            still ask you to verify your identity directly with us.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>Response Time:</strong> We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. Our goal is
            to address requests within 30 days. If we need more time (due to complexity or number of requests), we will
            let you know and explain the reason for the delay.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            <strong>No Fee (Generally):</strong> You will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights. However, if a
            request is excessive or manifestly unfounded (for example, repetitive requests), applicable law may allow us
            to charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request. We will never charge a fee without explaining
            why.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
            Finally, if we cannot fulfill a request in whole or in part, we will provide an explanation. For instance,
            if you request deletion of data that we are legally required to keep, we will inform you of that
            requirement.
